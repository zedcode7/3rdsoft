          <p>There are many things that can be done technically to improve your website’s performance. The only way to tell though what needs to be done is to test the website with various tools. We will run these tests against your website and let you know how well it performs. We will then propose a number of changes that we can make to improve your website’s performance. These tests will be rerun to ensure the changes are working and show how well your site performs.</p>

              <p>A database is the foundation of most software. If it is performing badly, it can affect many areas of your application such as the website, batch processes, report generation, and so forth. This poor performance can have negative effects on employee productivity, custom experience, and cost you a lot of money.</p>
              <p>We have 12+ years of experience working with relational databases such as MySQL, SQL Server, IBM DB2, MariaDB, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. At their heart a database is a collection of tables with the rows representing records and each column holding some type of data. Essentially a spreadsheet, but far more complicated and much more powerful. Having it work efficiently is one of the keys to proper database performance.</p>
              <p>We will review your schema which is the structure of your database. How the tables are made, columns are defined, indexes into the table and their primary keys. After a thorough review, changes will be proposed and can be made if you wish. We will then setup query logging and look for poor performing queries and determine why they are taking too long to complete. Again, more changes will be proposed and can be implemented by us or your staff.</p>
              <p>In addition to these types of changes, we are able to look at how your programs and programmers are using the database. Many times some simple changes in the programming code such as PHP, Java, or C# can have a big improvement on the performance of the database server. We look forward to helping you resolve your performance problems.</p>

They needed a way to check in the products when they arrived at their dock, mark what was damaged or missing, and generate labels for sending the received products to Amazon using the FBA service. We created a custom tool that used the BrightPearl API to gather PO information and a webpage where these PO’s could be easily searched and the problem products marked and labels printed. This saved the company a great deal of time in their warehouse and helped avoid errors that were occurring when trying to copy the data manually. They were able to modify their warehouse processed to streamline it some in the process which meant handling the products fewer times.</p>

Amazon requires splitting shipments to different fulfillment centers, and their warehouse was set up that each production line would collect and process a shipment to a single fulfillment center. Amazon had made changes to the FBA process, so the client needed a way to determine where a product was going to go when they received it.</p>    
              <p>We created a special tool that would check with Amazon where the product might go. The destination would be printed on the FNSKU label and this allowed them to route the products to where they were likely going to go. Although this wasn’t 100% accurate, most of the time it was correct and allowed them to keep their current processes in place and speed up processing in their warehouse. They had 50 people already trained and working with their current process well, and so changing it and retraining these people would have been a much more costly proposition.</p>

        <p>Knowing how much product to send to Amazon is something every seller needs to know. If you don’t send enough, then you run out of stock. If you send too many, then you pay storage fees. The client was using some reports that Amazon has for this purpose, but they wanted to take into account many more variables than the standard on-hand inventory, in-transit, sellable, and sales over the last 30 days. They wanted to take into account lead-time from the supplier, ordered inventory that was on its way from the supplier, time it took Amazon to check in their products when using UPS or LTL, and other variables that Amazon doesn’t account for.</p>
        <p>A velocity report tool was created for my website <a href="https://www.sellerstoolbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellersToolbox</a> which the client now has perpetual access. It allows for variations between suppliers of any length, variations in Amazon check-in times, sales history from 1 week to 1 year, purchase timeframe from 1 week to 1 year, and supplier filtering. It shows profitability and margin values based on cost, the number of days before the product will run out, the number of units and dollar amount that is an overage for slow-moving products, and more. They can now deal with foreign suppliers where it takes 2-3 months for products to arrive, as well as from a supplier that can deliver within 2-3 days. All of the data is downloadable to a spreadsheet for easier handling.</p>

              <p>There are many, many tools out there for Amazon sellers. Amazon lists 13 categories of them in their app store in Seller Central. There are 52 for working with product listings alone. While all these tools want to help your business save time and make more money, they all require you to work their way. You must alter your business processes and practices to fit how the tool works. This can be a difficult and expensive proposition if you are already using software to run your business. Sometimes all you need is to automate a certain process or bring data from Amazon into your tools so that you can work smarter and faster.</p>
              <p>We can create just the software you need so you don’t have to modify how your business works. We will create the bridges you need so that data can flow between your business and Amazon. This is a much cheaper proposition and much less disruptive to your business. You will get the benefits without having to go through the pain of changing how you work. While having custom software built for your business might sound expensive, it can actually be far cheaper in the long run. We already have experience with Amazon and have built the basics that are needed for report processing, updating inventory and listing data, creating shipments, and much more. We won’t be starting from scratch which means much fewer billable hours for you.</p>
